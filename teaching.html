        Over the last semester, I was the TA for PSY-2001 - Statistics and Research Methods I, under Professor Supriya Ray
        and the Teaching Fellow, Natania Narang. There was much learning in regards to the method of teaching itself. Condensing
        large amounts of information, and cherry-picking the ones that would be most useful is difficult. The challenge
        increases when students are at different levels of knowledge and understanding of such a subject. SRM I is the only
        course taken by Psychology students that incorporates a considerable amount of math and statistics, and often times
        there are many students who dropped math at various grades. So understanding the level and working up from there is
        something valuable I learnt, and very grateful for! I hope I was a supportive and understanding TA during my term <3
