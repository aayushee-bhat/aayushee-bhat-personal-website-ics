                <p>
            i didn't have any 'one' interest growing up and that really showed in college. i've tried 
            my hand in different subjects, and although right now i'm completing a bsc. psychology degree,
            i hope to study cs in the future (much more than a minor subject), and maybe someday marry cs + design •ᴗ•
